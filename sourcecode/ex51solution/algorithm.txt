There are two meanings of "validate" for credit cards: "syntactically valid", and "currently active account
with enough money for the given transaction".

Needless to say we're only doing the first of this at the moment, since we don't have a bank connection.

At present, valid card numbers must be 16 digits and validate according to the algorithm below.
The "IBM" or "Luhn" algorithm has been described as:
"the permutation s = (0)(1,2,4,8,7,5)(3,6)(9);
if n is even, s(a1) + a2 + s(a3)... else a2 + s(a2) + a3..."
(at http://www.academic.marist.edu/mwa/cccard.html) and
"For a card with an even number of digits, double every odd numbered digit and subtract 9 if the product 
is greater than 9. Add up all the even digits as well as the doubled-odd digits, and the result must 
be a multiple of 10 or it's not a valid card. 
If the card has an odd number of digits, perform the same addition doubling the 
even numbered digits instead." (http://www.phrack.org/show.php?p=47&a=8, quoted at
