== Ex53 -- Message Driven Bean

To run this at home you will have to do some configuration to create the JMS Queue.

On Wildfly you can set up the queue like so:

----
$ $WF_HOME/bin/jboss-cli.sh < wf-jms-queue.txt
----

On DOS/Windows use `%WF_HOME%\\bin\\jboss-cli.bat < wf-jms-queue.txt`

In either case you have to replace WF_HOME with the directory where Wildfly is installed.

The outputs should look something like the following. Lines with "#" are comments.

You are disconnected at the moment. Type 'connect' to connect to the server or 'help' for the list of supported commands.

        ],
        "legacy-entries" => undefined,
        "selector" => undefined
    }
