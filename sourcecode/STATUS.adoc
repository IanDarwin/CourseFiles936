Things to do on the load or your dev machine when upgrading

Close eclipse.

cd CourseFiles

git pull # megadiffs

Probably a good time to run the all-in script

start Eclipse

Window->Prefs->JBoss Tools->JBoss Central - uncheck Show at Startup. Click OK

remove junitbasic

new java project at donow21 # replaces junitbasic

remove ex41bonus, ex41bonussolution

new java project at {donow21solution, ex43solution, ex43clientsolution }

(After running mkHandsOns you will also have to create: donow21 ex43 ex43client)

Refresh in all projects (esp ex81solution which is a total rewrite

If ADT/AndMore is installed, you will get a popup when you run a unit test:
	Select Change Workspace Settings, set JUnit Run and Debug launcher to Eclipse. 

New feature: in sourcecode, do mvn compile, it will test that all the solutions compile.
