Course 936 Setup

This handout file was auto-generated from the same GIT repositories used to
auto-create the setup on the computers you used in the course. The
environment should be the same except that you will have to tell Eclipse
about the Eclipse projects if you want to use Eclipse. This is described
in the README file in the CourseFiles directory. If you just want to
work with Maven it should work out of the box. The directory structure from
the Zip file should be similar to the diagram at the front of the exercise
manual.
