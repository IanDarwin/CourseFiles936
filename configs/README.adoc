= Configs

Storehouse for key configuration files used in the deployment.

== PostgreSQL

cp -r modules/postgres WF_HOME/modules/system ??

merge datasources.txt into the right place in WF_HOME/standalone/config/standalone-full.xml

== MySQL (not tested in this release!)

cd to wildfly base directory

mkdir -p modules/system/layers/base/com/mysql/main

Copy mysql-module.xml and the driver jar of the same version number into that directory.

edit mysql-driver.txt into standalone/config/standaloneXXX.xml # whichever one you're using!

Cross your toes, sacrifice a goatee, and restart the server.
