= Setting Up The Environment

You should be able to use the same setup as we have on the course:

* Be sure you have an up-to-date Java SE (Java 11 or later);

* Be sure you have an up-to-date Maven (3.6+);

* Be sure you have an up-to-date Eclipse (2019.03 or later)

* Be sure you have the current M2E plug-in in your Eclipse install;

* Be sure you have a good relational database (PostgreSQL, or change all the persistence.xml files);

* Set up the link:databases.html[databases] used in the projects;

* Be sure you have a good EE App Server (WildFly, or change all the pom.xml files);

* Download the Course Zip file from Learning Tree

* Unzip the CourseFiles.zip into some directory

* Open the _sourcecode_ subdirectory as an Eclipse workspace. At this point you should see all the DoNow and ExXX projects.
If not you can add the ones you need; use File->New->Java Project and give the project name, and click Finish.

* Configure datasources in your application server.

* Start your application server.

* Try deploying ticketmanor: Open the project, RunAsâ†’Maven Build, set target to wildfly:deploy, click OK.
