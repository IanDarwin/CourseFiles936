= Maintenance

== Renames

Renaming is my least-fave form of maintenance.
When you rename a exXXsolution directory (which can only
be done if chapters are moved in the CN), remember:

1) Update the MA in Adapatlearn.
2) Find all occurrences of the old in the new, replace most/all. 
	REMEMBER, e.g.:
	grep -r ex51 ex61solution/
	If none that need to stay (e.g., back- or fwd-refs), add 'l':
	grep -lr ex51 ex61solution/ 
	If that looks right, run through xargs replace:
	grep -lr ex51 ex61solution/ | xargs replace ex51 ex61
