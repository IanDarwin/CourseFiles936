= Scripts

These are for Course 936 Team use, not for students.

It may be possible to merge these two scripts.

== all-in

Updates all the repos, builds exercise from solutions, etc.

== revirt

Punishly named, this lets you reset various files to their initial state, eg., after the TE has been
trying out some of the exercises.
